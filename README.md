Hello, my names Johanna. I've been working in the healthcare field for the past 9 going on 10 years as a CNA. I'm looking forward to doing something completely different.
I love video games. I'm not good at them.. I do try though haha but I think it would be awesome to deal with the making of a video game. 
I haven't really given it much thought to an actual career goal, I think I might need some help there. I am looking forward to learn new things in this class and this adventure into the computer science degree.
